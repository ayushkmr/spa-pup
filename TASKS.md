---

## üìù User Stories

| User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **As a Puppy Spa receptionist, I want to easily record a new puppy on the waiting list, so that I can have a sequenced list of puppies to be served** | - The process of entering puppies on the list must be as simple as writing it down on a piece of paper / word document / excel<br>- I should be able to record the name of the owner/puppy, the service they require and their time of arrival | High |
| **As a Puppy Spa receptionist, I want to be able to create a new waiting list for each day, so that I can organize each day's clients** | - I should be able to easily generate a new waiting list each day by simply clicking a button<br>- Each day should only have one waiting list associated with it | High |
| **As a Puppy Spa receptionist, I want to be able to see waiting lists from previous days, so that I can report our performance to the accountant** | - I should be able to see a full list of waiting list entries by day | Medium |
| **As a Puppy Spa receptionist, I want to be able to re-order the waiting list, so that it can reflect the real waiting list** | - I should be able to bump people up or down the waiting list | High |
| **As a Puppy Spa receptionist, I want to be able to mark clients that have been serviced off of the waiting list, so that I can only focus on clients that are still to be serviced** | - The process of marking a client as serviced must be as easy as ticking a check-box | High |
| **As a Puppy Spa receptionist, I want to be able to search the entire history of waiting list logs to find records related to a specific puppy, so that I can have a view of our service history to the puppy** | - The ability to search should allow for partial entry of the puppy's details | Low |
